* Requires:
	IPK:
		python3-pytz ???
		python3-psutil
		python3-asgiref
		python3-sqlparse
		libyaml

	PIP:
		channels
		django<6.0.0,>=5.0.6
		comicfn2dict

	hardware:
		at-least 1GB RAM

* Observations:
	- Open main page to a spinning wheel with no explanation of why.
	- Added users and they don't appear on-screen, but seem to be in the database as there's a brief flash of an error message stating something like "user already exists".
	- Added a new library that isn't then shown in browser window. Also seems to be in database as I can't re-add it.
	- Has a few issues working with sqlite3, locked database errors and such.
	- Not sure it's ready for prime-time just yet. UX needs to be much better. :(
